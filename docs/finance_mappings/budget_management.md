# Budget Management Mapping

**Full Forms**:
- AOP = Annual Operating Plan

**Simple Explanation**: Monitor actual expenses against budgeted amounts. ERPNext Budget module tracks variances.

## AS-IS Steps (from AS-IS_Process.xlsx)
1. Identification of actual expenses incurred every month and categorization into respective heads as per AOP (professional fees, salaries, administrative, office, etc).
2. Mapping of the same with the budgeted amount as per AOP.
3. Identification of reason of variances and justification.

## ERPNext Implementation Steps
Note: Budget management is out of scope per sheet feedback, but if implemented:
1. Set up Budget entries for expense categories.
2. Track actual expenses against budgets.
3. Generate variance reports with reasons.

## Pain Points (AS-IS)
- Actual invoice copies for booking entries or making provisions.
- Signed off AOP numbers.

## ERPNext Solutions
- Automated budget vs actual tracking.
- Alert system for budget overruns.
